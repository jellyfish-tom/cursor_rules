## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Copy the rules** to your project:
   ```bash
   cp -r .cursor/rules/ /path/to/your/project/.cursor/
   ```
3. **Start coding** with expert-level AI assistance!

## 📋 What's Included

### Core Rules (Always Applied)
- **`coding-guidelines.mdc`** - DRY principles, functional programming, minimal code changes
- **`development-methodology.mdc`** - Chain of thought, documentation-first approach
- **`project-standards.mdc`** - TypeScript strict typing, React ecosystem focus

### Context-Specific Rules
- **`typescript-react.mdc`** - Component patterns, hooks, accessibility, SEO
- **`chrome-extension.mdc`** - Manifest V3, security, performance
- **`typescript-patterns.mdc`** - ts-pattern usage, functional programming
- **`validation-architecture.mdc`** - Type guards, validation patterns
- **`refactoring-patterns.mdc`** - Code improvement strategies

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Expert Knowledge Integration** - AI operates at senior developer level
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - TypeScript, React, performance, accessibility, SEO
- **Context-Aware** - Rules activate based on file types and project context
- **Priority-Based** - Core principles always take precedence
- **Practical Examples** - Concrete, actionable code snippets

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.cursor/rules/
├── coding-guidelines.mdc       # Core principles (alwaysApply: true, priority: high)
├── development-methodology.mdc # Methodology (alwaysApply: true, priority: high)
├── project-standards.mdc       # Standards (alwaysApply: true, priority: high)
├── typescript-react.mdc        # React patterns (priority: medium)
├── chrome-extension.mdc        # Extension dev (priority: medium)
├── typescript-patterns.mdc     # ts-pattern usage (priority: medium)
├── validation-architecture.mdc # Validation (priority: medium)
└── refactoring-patterns.mdc    # Refactoring (priority: low)
```

## 🔧 How It Works

The system uses a three-tier architecture:

1. **Always-Applied Core Rules** - Foundation principles that apply to every interaction
2. **Context-Specific Rules** - Targeted guidance that activates based on file types
3. **Priority-Based Hierarchy** - Ensures core principles always take precedence

## 💡 Example Usage

After installing the rules, Cursor AI will:

- Generate TypeScript components with proper interfaces and accessibility
- Suggest performance optimizations and best practices
- Provide expert-level guidance on React patterns and hooks
- Ensure code follows DRY principles and functional programming
- Include proper error handling and validation patterns

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to modify the rules to match your team's preferences:

- Update naming conventions
- Add project-specific patterns
- Adjust priority levels
- Include additional context-specific rules

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to:

- Report issues or bugs
- Suggest new rules or improvements
- Submit pull requests
- Share your experiences and use cases
